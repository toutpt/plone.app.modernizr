About Modernizr
===============

Modernizr is an open-source JavaScript library that helps you build the next 
generation of HTML5 and CSS3-powered websites.

Modernizr is a script that detects native CSS3 and HTML5 features available in
the current UA and provides an object containing all features with a true/false
value, depending on whether the UA has native support for it or not.

Modernizr will also add classes to the element of the page, one for each feature
it detects. If the UA supports it, a class like "cssgradients" will be added. 
If not, the class name will be "no-cssgradients". This allows for simple
if-conditionals in your CSS, giving you fine control over the look & feel of
your website.
